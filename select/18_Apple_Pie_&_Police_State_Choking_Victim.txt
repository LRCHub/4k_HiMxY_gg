The prisons make this country great;
Apple pie and police state.
The security that the children know
Is not worth it if this is where they'll go.
Maximum security facilites,
Was once a threat, puts my mind at ease.
A jail for every town and every state...
"Oh god, ain't this country great?"
Broken promises from government whores,
While the state complains of revolving doors.
No soulution for society's disease;
But more problems as they throw away the keys.
WHY? WHY? WHY? WHYYYYY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? 1, 2, FUCK YOU!
A thousand convicts sit still waiting for death,
As I sigh for relief, I exhale my breath.
Jail for every town and every state...
"Oh god, ain't this country great!?"
WHY? WHY? WHY? WHYYYYY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY?
Ain't it great! (8x)
