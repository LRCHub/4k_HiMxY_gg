And I'm droppin them hams - shit - ham squad on deck!
Future Entertainment, Tjs DJs
Nigga with clinic, my nigga swag
Playboy tre, george dirt
Nigga we doin this, niggaa, you do not see this nigga?

(Ohh) Well ain't nothing like backing thighs, yeah
There ain't nothing like a big old side, yeah (uh huh)
Just can't nothing feed my appetite (like what?)
Like a big old slice of sweet apple pie (aha)

Ain't nothing like backing thighs, yeah
There ain't nothing a big old bride, yeah
So i ran and got when i die (that what?)
That heaven don't have sweet apple pie (aye)

(Haahhh) You know what is don't play yourself
Cause you know you want to do this while you play with yourself
Don't act like you ain't human girl, no I ain't swooping
How you think babies got here, you made it yourself
Cause everything is mutual (for show)
So let me get a slice of that, and get me through the go (for show)
Cause I am working girl, and yeah that thing a funeral (for show)
Don't be tripping weed on the judge, judicial (nah)
But you the cutest, so you mean as hell as usual (what's up?)
You wanted [?], when I tell you, you get moody though (what's up?)
You won't miss the right, well it's something you should know
He may seem nice but every nigga got two of those (So?)
So I ain't moving slow
